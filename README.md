# hello-world
Welcome to my first repository!
I am your host with the most, the slightly strange and sorta smelly DaNewbieCoder!
I dabble in c, C++, Java and web coding.
I am currently re-learning Java programming.
Java is just a hobby right now, however I am hoping to make it into something more.
Thanks for reading this and have a good morning/afternoon/night!
